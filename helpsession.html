<h1>UX UW Consultation Sessions</h1>
<p>How can I make sure my project provides <strong>the best experience to the targeted users?</strong><br><br> 
    If you have been struggling with this question or anything similar, look 
    no further! <a href="/about"> UX designers</a> here at UW provide free consultation sessions to <strong>UW 
    associated projects/groups</strong>. If you want to learn more about how UX can be incorporated, 
    please visit this page. (Jason I think you are making this page?) <br><br>

These consultation sessions are <strong>every Thursday from 3:00-4:00 at the University District Building.</strong> </p>
<h2>What should I expect in these consultation sessions?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2-4 UX designers</strong> will be present</li>
    <li>We can provide feedback on everything from high-level workflows 
        and process to page layout, visual design, terminology, and your underlying HTML and CSS.</li>
    <li>Depending on what type of feedback you have requested, we may draw on the whiteboard, pull 
        up your screens or other examples on the monitor to review, or simply have in-depth discussions 
        about your questions.</li>
    <li>We’ll make recommendations and provide rationale for them, to help guide you in future similar 
        situations. (Note that these are <strong>recommendations only</strong>; we do not implement them for you.) </li>
    <li>In the last few minutes of the session, we’ll review the major points for clarity.</li>
    <li>After the meeting, we’ll <strong>email you the recommendations and rationale.</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>Before filling out the form...</h2>

    <p>Start by reflecting on where you are in your process, and where a design review would 
        be most helpful for you. A few things to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While a design review can be useful at any stage in the development process, in general, 
                <strong>the earlier the better</strong>. You don’t need to have a product yet; the team can help with concepts, 
                designing data gathering instruments, reviewing data and creating recommendations, and plenty 
                of other early-stage tasks.</li>
            <li>If it’s too late to make any changes to your product before it launches, <strong>it’s too late for a 
                review.</strong> However, if there will be another iteration, come back to us before that process begins.</li>
        </ul>
