<h1>UX UW Consultation Sessions</h1>
<p>How can I make sure my project provides <strong>the best experience to the targeted users?</strong></p>
    <a href="/about"> UX designers</a> here at UW are here to assist you in creating this experience for <strong>UW 
    associated projects/groups</strong>. 

<p>Sign up for one of these consultation sessions below, which are <strong>every Thursday from 3:00-4:00 at the University District Building.</strong> These 
    sessions are free, though we wouldn't say no to a box of doughnuts. üç©</p>


   <p>Please provide <strong>as much detailed information for the questions on this form</strong>, so that our team can prepare to give 
you the most efficient and effective feedback possible. Please keep in mind that while a design review can be useful at any stage in the development process, 
in general, <strong>the earlier the better</strong>. If it‚Äôs too late to make any changes to your product before it launches, it‚Äôs too late for a review. </p>
<p>If your request has been accepted, you will be receiving an email that includes instruction on <strong>how to prepare 
    for the session.</strong></p>

<h2>What should I expect in these consultation sessions?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2-4 UX designers</strong> will be present</li>
    <li>We can provide feedback on everything from high-level workflows 
        and process to page layout, visual design, terminology, and your underlying HTML and CSS.</li>
    <li>Depending on what type of feedback you have requested, we may draw on the whiteboard, pull 
        up your screens or other examples on the monitor to review, or simply have in-depth discussions 
        about your questions.</li>
    <li>We‚Äôll make recommendations and provide rationale for them, to help guide you in future similar 
        situations. (Note that these are <strong>recommendations only</strong>; we do not implement them for you.) </li>
    <li>In the last few minutes of the session, we‚Äôll review the major points for clarity.</li>
    <li>After the meeting, we‚Äôll <strong>email you the recommendations and rationale.</strong></li>
</ul>
