<h1>Who's behind the site?</h1>
<hr width ="95%"><br>
<h2>Charlon</h2>
<p>Charlon Palacay is focused.  Seriously focused. You think you can get his attention with a priority URGENT email? 
    A standing Exchange invitation? A well-aimed paperclip to the forehead? Not when Char is on the job! At first we 
    worried, but soon realized that he was on a private astral plane, consulting his inner Design and Development gurus 
    for answers. And answers he has! Whether for how to test the latest design decisions with end-users or what changes 
    to the front-end framework will lead to higher page load-times, it is all user-experience in his mystical worldview.</p>
<h2>Diego</h2>
<p>If you've submitted or received grades here at the UW in the last few years, you can give Diego Bejarano a high-five 
    next time you see him. He was heavily involved in the design of GradePage, the tool that lets instructors submit grades 
    online. His brain runs on kudos, so fire them away if you have them. Little know fact, Diego also hosts a personal website
    for his poetry, art, and photography.</p>
<h2>Lauren</h2>
<p>We were glad to know Lauren Manes before she bought the farm - and after, because now she brings us eggs! She brings bushels
    of skill and experience to bear on the projects she’s on and can always be counted on to help wrangle resources, designers, 
    inspiration - even cows, because why not - to craft beautiful user experiences.</p>
<h2>William</h2>
<p>William is passionate about design of systems--from information systems to social systems that surround us. His systemic thinking 
    is rooted in his unique academic background: Systems Engineering and Human-centered Design & Engineering. Over a decade ago he 
    introduced the UCD approach to UW-IT and he has been a strong advocate for end-users and user-centered-design(UCD) evangelist 
    ever since. But William’s empathy is not limited to users. He is an approachable designer to his colleagues and all-around nice 
    person, often conversing with strangers on the Ave. <br>He loves what he does. And heads up--William will walk up to you with nice 
    smile and strike a conversation. Sooner or later, you'll find yourself interacting with his prototype in usability study session!</p>
